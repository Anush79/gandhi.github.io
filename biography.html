                    1948) was the father of the Indian
                    independence movement.
                    While fighting discrimination in South Africa, Gandhi developed satyagraha, a nonviolent way of
                    protesting injustice. Returning to his birthplace of India, Gandhi spent his remaining years working
                    to
                    end British rule of his country and to better the lives of India's poorest classes.<br>

                    Mohandas Gandhi was born October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, the last child of his father
                    Karamchand
                    Gandhi and his fourth wife Putlibai. Young Gandhi was a shy, mediocre student. At age 13, he married
                    Kasturba Kapadia as part of an arranged marriage. She bore four sons and supported Gandhi's
                    endeavors
                    until
                    her 1944 death.<br><br>
                    In September 1888 at age 18, Gandhi left India alone to study law in London. He attempted to become
                    an
                    English gentleman, buying suits, fine-tuning his English accent, learning French, and taking music
                    lessons.
                    Deciding that was a waste of time and money, he spent the rest of his three-year stay as a serious
                    student
                    living a simple lifestyle.<br><br>

                    Gandhi also adopted vegetarianism and joined the London Vegetarian Society, whose intellectual crowd
                    introduced Gandhi to authors Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. He also studied the "Bhagavad
                    Gita,"
                    an
                    epic poem sacred to Hindus. These books' concepts set the foundation for his later beliefs.<br><br>

                    Gandhi passed the bar on June 10, 1891, and returned to India. For two years, he attempted to
                    practice
                    law
                    but lacked the knowledge of Indian law and the self-confidence necessary to be a trial lawyer.
                    Instead,
                    he
                    took on a year-long case in South Africa.</P>

                        At 23, Gandhi again left his family and set off for the British-governed Natal province in South
                        Africa
                        in May 1893. After a week, Gandhi was asked to go to the Dutch-governed Transvaal province. When
                        Gandhi
                        boarded the train, railroad officials ordered him to move to the third-class car. Gandhi,
                        holding
                        first-class tickets, refused. A policeman threw him off the train.<br><br>

                        As Gandhi talked to Indians in South Africa, he learned that such experiences were common.
                        Sitting in
                        the cold depot that first night of his trip, Gandhi debated returning to India or fighting the
                        discrimination. He decided that he couldn't ignore these injustices.<br><br>

                        Gandhi spent 20 years bettering Indians' rights in South Africa, becoming a resilient, potent
                        leader
                        against
                        discrimination. <br><br>He learned about Indian grievances, studied the law, wrote letters to
                        officials,
                        and
                        organized
                        petitions.<br><br> On May 22, 1894, Gandhi established the Natal Indian Congress (NIC). Although
                        it
                        began as an
                        organization for
                        wealthy Indians, Gandhi expanded it to all classes and castes.<br><br> He became a leader of
                        South
                        Africa's
                        Indian community,
                        his activism covered by newspapers in England and India.</P>

                        In 1896 after three years in South Africa, Gandhi sailed to India to bring his wife and two sons
                        back
                        with him, returning in November. <br><br>Gandhi's ship was quarantined at the harbor for 23
                        days, but
                        the real reason for the delay was an angry mob of whites at the dock who believed Gandhi was
                        returning
                        with Indians who would overrun South Africa.<br><br>

                        Gandhi sent his family to safety, but he was assaulted with bricks, rotten eggs, and fists.
                        Police
                        escorted him away. <br><br>Gandhi refuted the claims against him but refused to prosecute those
                        involved. The violence stopped, strengthening Gandhi's prestige.

                        Influenced by the "Gita," Gandhi wanted to purify his life by following the concepts of
                        aparigraha
                        (nonpossession) and samabhava (equitability). <br><br>A friend gave him "Unto This Last" by John
                        Ruskin,
                        which inspired Gandhi to establish Phoenix Settlement, a community outside Durban, in June 1904.
                        <br><br>The settlement focused on eliminating needless possessions and living in full equality.
                        Gandhi
                        moved his family and his newspaper, the Indian Opinion, to the settlement.

                        In 1906, believing that family life was detracting from his potential as a public advocate,
                        Gandhi took
                        the vow of brahmacharya (abstinence from sex). <br><br>He simplified his vegetarianism to
                        unspiced,
                        usually uncooked foods—mostly fruits and nuts, which he believed would help quiet his urges.

                font-size: 1.1em;
                margin: 20px 0 10px 0px;">


                        Gandhi believed that his vow of brahmacharya allowed him the focus to devise the concept of
                        satyagraha
                        in late 1906. In the simplest sense, satyagraha is passive resistance, but Gandhi described it
                        as "truth
                        force," or natural right.<br><br> He believed exploitation was possible only if the exploited
                        and the
                        exploiter
                        accepted it, so seeing beyond the current situation provided power to change it.<br><br>

                        In practice, satyagraha is nonviolent resistance to injustice.<br><br> A person using satyagraha
                        could
                        resist
                        injustice by refusing to follow an unjust law or putting up with physical assaults and/or
                        confiscation
                        of his property without anger.<br> There would be no winners or losers; all would understand the
                        "truth"
                        and
                        agree to rescind the unjust law.

                        Gandhi first organized satyagraha against the Asiatic Registration Law, or Black Act, which
                        passed in
                        March 1907.<br><br> It
                        required all Indians to be fingerprinted and carry registration documents at all times. Indians
                        refused
                        fingerprinting
                        and picketed documentation offices.<br><br> Protests were organized, miners went on strike, and
                        Indians
                        illegally traveled from
                        Natal to the Transvaal in opposition to the act.<br><br> Many protesters, including Gandhi, were
                        beaten
                        and
                        arrested. After
                        sev
                        en years of protest, the Black Act was repealed. The nonviolent protest had succeeded.</P>

                        After 20 years in South Africa, Gandhi returned to India. By the time he arrived, press reports
                        of his
                        South African triumphs had made him a national hero. <br><br>He traveled the country for a year
                        before beginning
                        reforms. Gandhi found that his fame conflicted with observing conditions of the poor, so he wore
                        a
                        loincloth (dhoti) and sandals, the garb of the masses, during this journey. In cold weather, he
                        added a
                        shawl. This became his lifetime wardrobe.<br><br>

                        Gandhi founded another communal settlement in Ahmadabad called Sabarmati Ashram. For the next 16
                        years,
                        Gandhi lived there with his family.<br><br>

                        He was also given the honorary title of Mahatma, or "Great Soul." Many credit Indian poet
                        Rabindranath
                        Tagore, winner of the 1913 Nobel Prize for Literature, for awarding Gandhi this name.
                        <br><br>Peasants viewed
                        Gandhi as a holy man, but he disliked the title because it implied he was special. He viewed
                        himself as
                        ordinary.<br><br>

                        After the year ended, Gandhi still felt stifled because of World War I. As part of satyagraha,
                        Gandhi
                        had vowed never to take advantage of an opponent's troubles. <br><br>With the British in a major
                        conflict,
                        Gandhi couldn't fight them for Indian freedom. Instead, he used satyagraha to erase inequities
                        among
                        Indians.<br><br>Gandhi persuaded landlords to stop forcing tenant farmers to pay increased rent
                        by appealing to
                        their morals and fasted to convince mill owners to settle a strike. <br><br>Because of Gandhi's
                        prestige, people
                        didn't want to be responsible for his death from fasting.

                        When the war ended, Gandhi focused on the fight for Indian self-rule (swaraj).<br><br> In 1919,
                        the British
                        handed Gandhi a cause: the Rowlatt Act, which gave the British nearly free rein to detain
                        "revolutionary" elements without trial. <br><br>Gandhi organized a hartal (strike), which began
                        on March 30,
                        1919. Unfortunately, the protest turned violent.

                        Gandhi ended the hartal once he heard about the violence, but more than 300 Indians had died and
                        more
                        than 1,100 were injured from British reprisals in the city of Amritsar.<br><br> Satyagraha
                        hadn't been achieved,
                        but the Amritsar Massacre fueled Indian opinions against the British. The violence showed Gandhi
                        that
                        the Indian people didn't fully believe in satyagraha. He spent much of the 1920s advocating for
                        it and
                        struggling to keep protests peaceful.<br><br>

                        Gandhi also began advocating self-reliance as a path to freedom. Since the British established
                        India as
                        a colony, Indians had supplied Britain with raw fiber and then imported the resulting cloth from
                        England.<br><br> Gandhi advocated that Indians spin their own cloth, popularizing the idea by
                        traveling with a
                        spinning wheel, often spinning yarn while giving a speech.<br><br> The image of the spinning
                        wheel (charkha)
                        became a symbol for independence.<br>

                        In March 1922, Gandhi was arrested and sentenced to six years in prison for sedition. After two
                        years,
                        he was released following surgery to find his country embroiled in violence between Muslims and
                        Hindus.<br><br>
                        When Gandhi began a 21-day fast still ill from surgery, many thought he would die, but he
                        rallied. The
                        fast created a temporary peace.</P>

                        In December 1928, Gandhi and the Indian National Congress (INC) announced a challenge to the
                        British
                        government. If India wasn't granted Commonwealth status by December 31, 1929, they would
                        organize a
                        nationwide protest against British taxes. The deadline passed without change.<br><br>

                        Gandhi chose to protest the British salt tax because salt was used in everyday cooking, even by
                        the
                        poorest. The Salt March began a nationwide boycott starting March 12, 1930, when Gandhi and 78
                        followers
                        walked 200 miles from the Sabarmati Ashram to the sea. <br><br>The group grew along the way,
                        reaching 2,000 to
                        3,000. When they reached the coastal town of Dandi on April 5, they prayed all night. <br><br>In
                        the morning,
                        Gandhi made a presentation of picking up a piece of sea salt from the beach. Technically, he had
                        broken
                        the law.<br><br>

                        Thus began an endeavor for Indians to make salt. Some picked up loose salt on the beaches, while
                        others
                        evaporated saltwater. Indian-made salt soon was sold nationwide.<br><br> Peaceful picketing and
                        marches were
                        conducted. The British responded with mass arrests.<br><br><br><br>

                        When Gandhi announced a march on the government-owned Dharasana Saltworks, the British
                        imprisoned him
                        without trial.<br><br> Although they hoped Gandhi's arrest would stop the march, they
                        underestimated his
                        followers. The poet Sarojini Naidu led 2,500 marchers. <br><br>As they reached the waiting
                        police, the marchers
                        were beaten with clubs. News of the brutal beating of peaceful protesters shocked the
                        world.<br><br>

                        British viceroy Lord Irwin met with Gandhi and they agreed on the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, which
                        granted
                        limited salt production and freedom for the protesters if Gandhi called off the protests.
                        <br><br>While many
                        Indians believed that Gandhi hadn't gotten enough from the negotiations, he viewed it as a step
                        toward
                        independence.<br><br><br><br>

                        When Gandhi was released in 1944, independence seemed near. Huge disagreements, however, arose
                        between
                        Hindus and Muslims.<br><br> Because the majority of Indians were Hindu, Muslims feared losing
                        political power if
                        India became independent. The Muslims wanted six provinces in northwest India, where Muslims
                        predominated, to become an independent country.<br><br> Gandhi opposed partitioning India and
                        tried to bring the
                        sides together, but that proved too difficult even for the Mahatma.<br><br>

                        Violence erupted; entire towns were burned. Gandhi toured India, hoping his presence could curb
                        the
                        violence. Although violence stopped where Gandhi visited, he couldn't be everywhere.<br><br>

                        The British, seeing India headed for civil war, decided to leave in August 1947. Before leaving,
                        they
                        got the Hindus, against Gandhi's wishes, to agree to a partition plan. <br><br>On August 15,
                        1947, Britain
                        granted independence to India and to the newly formed Muslim country of Pakistan.<br><br>

                        Millions of Muslims marched from India to Pakistan, and millions of Hindus in Pakistan walked to
                        India.<br><br>
                        Many refugees died from illness, exposure, and dehydration. As 15 million Indians became
                        uprooted from
                        their homes, Hindus and Muslims attacked each other.<br><br>

                        Gandhi once again went on a fast. He would only eat again, he stated, once he saw clear plans to
                        stop
                        the violence. The fast began on January 13, 1948. Realizing that the frail, aged Gandhi couldn't
                        withstand a long fast, the sides collaborated. <br><br>On January 18, more than 100
                        representatives approached
                        Gan
                        dhi with a promise for peace, ending his fast.<br></P>

                        Not everyone approved of the plan. Some radical Hindu groups believed that India shouldn't have
                        been
                        partitioned, blaming Gandhi. <br><br>On January 30, 1948, the 78-year-old Gandhi spent his day
                        discussing
                        issues. Just past 5 p.m., Gandhi began the walk, supported by two grandnieces, to the Birla
                        House, where
                        he was staying in New Delhi, for a prayer meeting. <br><br>A crowd surrounded him. A young Hindu
                        named Nathuram
                        Godse stopped before him and bowed. Gandhi bowed back. Godse shot Gandhi three times.<br><br>
                        Although Gandhi
                        had survived five other assassination attempts, he fell to the ground, dead.<br><br>

                        Gandhi's concept of nonviolent protest attracted the organizers of numerous demonstrations and
                        movements. Civil rights leaders, especially Martin Luther King Jr., adopted Gandhi's model for
                        their own
                        struggles.<br><br>

                        Research in the second half of the 20th century established Gandhi as a great mediator and
                        reconciler,
                        resolving conflicts between older moderate politicians and young radicals, political terrorists
                        and
                        parliamentarians, urban intelligentsia and rural masses, Hindus and Muslims, as well as Indians
                        and
                        British.<br><br> He was the catalyst, if not the initiator, of three major revolutions of the
                        20th century:
                        movements against colonialism, racism, and violence.<br><br>

                        His deepest strivings were spiritual, but unlike many fellow Indians with such aspirations, he
                        didn't
                        retire to a Himalayan cave to meditate. Rather, he took his cave with him everywhere he
                        went.<br><br> And, he
                        left his thoughts to posterity: His collected writings had reached 100 volumes by the early 21st
                        century.</P>
